PART-1

1. Your browser is running HTTP version 1.1, as indicated by the "GET" request line in the HTTP message ("GET /wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html HTTP/1.1"). The server is also running HTTP version 1.1, as shown in the response message ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK").

2. Your browser can accept languages English, as indicated by the "Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5" line in the HTTP request message.

3. The IP address of your computer is "10.196.12.136", and the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu server is "128.119.245.12", as shown in the Source and Destination columns respectively.

4. The status code returned from the server to your browser is "200 OK", indicating that the request has succeeded.

5. The HTML file that you are retrieving was last modified at the server on Tue, 16 Jan 2024 06:59:02 GMT, as shown in the "Last-Modified" header in the HTTP response message.

6. The content length of the HTML file that you are retrieving is 128 bytes, as shown in the "Content-Length" header in the HTTP response message, we can also view this in "File Data" header in the HTTP response message.

7. By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, you can see some headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window, such as "Connection: close" and "Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)" in the HTTP response message.

PART-2


1. No, you will not see an "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" line in the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. This is because the browser does not have a cached copy of the file, so it does not need to check if the file has been modified since the last time it was fetched.

2. Yes, the server explicitly returned the contents of the file in the first server response. You can tell this by looking at the "Content-Length" header, which indicates the size of the file in bytes, and the "Content-Type" header, which indicates the

3. Yes, there is an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET request. The information that follows the header is “Tue, 16 Jan 2024 06:59:02 GMT”. This means that the browser is asking the server to send the file only if it has been modified since that date and time. This is a way of implementing conditional GET requests, which can reduce network traffic and improve performance.

4.The HTTP status code returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET is “304 Not Modified.” The server did not explicitly return the contents of the file because this status code indicates that the requested resource has not been modified since the last request, so there’s no need to retransmit it. This is a way of implementing conditional GET requests, which can reduce network traffic and improve performance


PART-3

1. The web browser initiated a single HTTP GET request message, as evident from the Wireshark capture. The specific GET message for the Bill of Rights can be identified in frame number 386.
Packet Number for GET Message for the Bill of Rights:
The HTTP GET request for the Bill of Rights is encapsulated in frame number 386. This particular packet captures the moment when the browser sought the specific content related to the Bill of Rights.

2. The pertinent status code and corresponding phrase in response to the HTTP GET request are encapsulated in frame number 410. This frame provides insight into the server's acknowledgment of the client's request.

3. In response to the HTTP GET request, the server communicated a status code of "200," signifying a successful request, and the accompanying phrase "OK." This standard HTTP response code indicates that the requested operation was carried out successfully by the server.

4. The HTTP response, including the content of the Bill of Rights, is distributed across two reassembled TCP segments: frame number 409 (4380 bytes) and frame number 410 (481 bytes). This segmentation highlights the structured nature of the data transfer, requiring two segments for the complete HTTP response and the inclusion of the Bill of Rights text.


PART-4

1. HTTP GET Requests and Destination Addresses:
   - The browser sent a total of three HTTP GET request messages.
   - The GET requests were sent to the following Internet addresses:
     - For the first GET request (frame 499):
       - Destination Address: 128.119.245.12 (gaia.cs.umass.edu)
     - For the second GET request (frame 528):
       - Destination Address: 128.119.245.12 (gaia.cs.umass.edu)
     - For the third GET request (frame 585):
       - Destination Address: 178.79.137.164 (kurose.cslash.net)

2. Downloading Images Serially or in Parallel:
   - Analyzing the HTTP GET requests for the two images:
     - The second GET request (frame 528) is for the image at http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/pearson.png.
     - The third GET request (frame 585) is for the image at http://kurose.cslash.net/8E_cover_small.jpg.
   - The browser initiated the requests to different Internet addresses (gaia.cs.umass.edu and kurose.cslash.net), indicating that these requests were meant for distinct resources.
   - The requests for the images were performed in parallel, as they were directed to different servers. This parallelization enables the browser to download resources concurrently, enhancing the overall efficiency and reducing the time needed to load all the required content.

PART-5

1. Server's Response to the Initial HTTP GET:
   - The initial HTTP GET request (frame 1721) from the browser is met with a response from the server (frame 1783).
   - The server's response includes the following information:
     - **Status Code:** 401 (Unauthorized)
     - **Status Phrase:** Unauthorized
   - This indicates that the server requires authentication, and the browser needs to provide valid credentials to access the requested resource.

2. New Field in the HTTP GET Message for the Second Time:
   - In the second HTTP GET request (frame 3464) sent by the browser, there is a new field included in the HTTP GET message:
     - **Authorization:** This field is added to carry the credentials required for authentication. It contains information such as a username and password or other authentication tokens.
   - The inclusion of the Authorization field is a way for the browser to provide the necessary credentials to the server, addressing the authentication challenge presented in the initial response with the 401 status code.
