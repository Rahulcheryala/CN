PART 3

1.	Actions -> DHCP Release and Deauthentication. I expected to see Dissassociation request.
2.	13 Authentication Requests.
3.	Host want it to be open. Authentication Algorithm: Open System (0).
4.	I canâ€™t find any reply from the AP. This is may be because the AP is configured to require a key when associating with that AP, so the AP is likely ignoring requests for open access.
5.	Host -> AP : 63.168087s | AP -> Host : 63.169071s
6.	ASSOCIATE REQUEST : 63.169910. | ASSOCIATE RESPONSE : 63.192101
7.	From Host : Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, [Mbit/sec]
				Extended Supported Rates 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]
	From AP   : Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), [Mbit/sec]
				Extended Supported Rates 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]
	Overall both Host and AP are willing to use above transmission rates. Transmission rates in both are same.

		Receiver address: Intel_1f:57:13 (00:12:f0:1f:57:13)
		BSS Id: CiscoLinksys_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
		
	A PROBE REQUEST is used by a host in active scanning to find an Access Point. A PROBE RESPONSE is sent by the access point to the host sending the request.
